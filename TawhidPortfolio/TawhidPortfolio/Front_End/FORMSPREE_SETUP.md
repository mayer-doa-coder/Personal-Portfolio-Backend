# Formspree Setup Instructions

## What is Formspree?
Formspree is a form backend service that allows you to receive form submissions directly to your email without setting up a server. It's perfect for static websites and portfolios.

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Create a Formspree Account
- Go to [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
- Sign up for a free account (allows 50 submissions per month)
- Verify your email address

### 2. Create a New Form
- After logging in, click "New Form"
- Enter a name for your form (e.g., "Portfolio Contact Form")
- Choose your email address where you want to receive submissions
- Click "Create Form"

### 3. Get Your Form Endpoint
- After creating the form, you'll get a unique endpoint URL that looks like:
  ```
  https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
  ```
- Copy this URL

### 4. Update Your HTML Form
- Open `TawhidPortfolio/Front_End/home.html`
- Find the contact form (around line 465)
- Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in the form action with your actual Form ID:
  ```html
  <form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_FORM_ID" method="POST" id="contactForm">
  ```

### 5. Test Your Form
- Open your portfolio website
- Fill out and submit the contact form
- You should receive an email with the form submission
- The first submission will require email verification

## Features Included:

? **Email Notifications**: Instant email delivery
? **Auto-Response**: Optional auto-reply to form submitters
? **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation

## Advanced Configuration (Optional):

### Custom Thank You Page
Add this hidden field to redirect users after submission:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you.html">
```

### Auto-Reply to User
Add this to send an auto-reply to the person who submitted the form:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="_autoresponse" value="Thanks for contacting me! I'll get back to you soon.">
```

### Customize Email Subject
The subject line of emails you receive:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Portfolio Contact: {{ subject }}">
```

## Upgrade Options:
- **Gold Plan ($8/month)**: 1,000 submissions/month, file uploads, advanced features
- **Platinum Plan ($15/month)**: 5,000 submissions/month, integrations, analytics

## Troubleshooting:
- Make sure to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Form ID
- Check spam folder for email notifications
- Verify your email address with Formspree
- Ensure form has proper field names (`name`, `_replyto`, `subject`, `message`)
